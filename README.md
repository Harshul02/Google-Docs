### TextEditor

The TextEditor component provides a rich text editing experience with features like formatting text (bold, italic, underline), changing font styles, adjusting alignment, changing font size, adding links, and more. It uses the react-draft-wysiwyg npm package to implement these functionalities. The TextEditor component also includes a sidebar component for Google icons.

### Sidebar

The sidebar component displays a set of Google Apps icons using an array of objects. By utilizing the map function, I dynamically rendered the icons in the sidebar. Each object in the array represents an app and contains information such as the app's link, image, and name.

  ```
      {sideBarIcon.map((item)=> {
                return(
                <SidebarIcon 
                 Link={item.link} 
                 Image={item.image} 
                 name={item.name} 
                 />
                )
         })}
  ```
